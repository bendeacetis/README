Hi! I'm Ben a junior at the University of Minnesota on track to obtain a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in User Experience Design. I am interested in obtaining a career in full-stack development as well as cybersecurity. 

Included in my repos are some projects that I have worked on in my free time or through my academics at school.
